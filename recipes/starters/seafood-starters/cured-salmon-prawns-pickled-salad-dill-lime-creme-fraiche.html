        <h1> Salmon Prawns Salad Recipe </h1></a>
        <p>Prep: 40 Mins.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
        <p>550g salmon fillet, skin on.
2 sticks lemongrass, roughly chopped.
125g caster or granulated sugar, plus 2 tsp and another 2 tbsp.
150g coarse sea salt.
2 limes, zested, 1 juiced.
5 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar, plus a dash.
2 garlic cloves, crushed.
small bunch coriander (half of 28g pack).
20g pack dill.
2 fresh red Thai chillies, sliced (deseeded if you don’t like it too hot).
140g baby turnips, skin on.
1 small red onion, peeled.
6 tbsp full-fat crème fraîche.
12 large cooked peeled prawns.</p>
        <h2> Method: </h2>
        <p>STEP 1: Check the fish for bones and, if needed, remove with tweezers. To make the cure, put the lemongrass, 125g sugar, the salt, lime juice, zest of 1 lime, 1 tbsp rice vinegar, 1 garlic clove, the coriander and half of the dill, including stems, into a food processor. Blitz until the lemongrass is finely chopped, then stir in a quarter of the sliced chillies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 2: Cross two large pieces of cling film in a roasting tin and spoon on a third of the cure, then top with the fish. Cover the fish with the rest of the cure. Wrap tightly and leave for 36-48 hrs, then scrape off the cure, rinse the fish in cold water and pat dry. The fillet will feel firm.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 3: On the day of serving, start the other elements of the recipe. Shave the turnips into very thin slices using a mandoline, then plunge them into iced water with a dash of the vinegar. Leave for an hour, then drain well. Thinly slice the onion and mix with the turnip slices, 2 tbsp vinegar, 2 tsp sugar and a pinch of salt. Cover and steep for at least 1 hr, or chill for a few hrs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 4: Finely chop the remaining dill leaves and stir most of them into the crème fraîche with the remaining lime zest and a little seasoning, then chill.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 5: For the dressing, stir together the remaining 2 tbsp sugar, 2 tbsp vinegar, another quarter of the sliced chillies and the crushed garlic and leave until the sugar dissolves.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 6:Slice the fish into approx 20 slices, taking the knife down to the skin, then easing the blade underneath each piece to remove it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 7: When ready to serve, spoon and swoosh the dill crème fraîche down the middle of each plate, then top with overlapping salmon slices. Add 3 prawns per serving. Lift the salad from its juices and mound to one side. Scatter with a little extra dill and the remaining sliced chillies, then drizzle the dressing over the fish and prawns (or let your guests do that bit at the table).</p>
