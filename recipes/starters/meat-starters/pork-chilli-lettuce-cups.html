        <h1> Pork & Chilli Lettuce Cups Recipe </h1></a>
        <p>Prep: 25 Mins. Cook 15 Mins.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
        <p> 1 tbsp vegetable oil. 1 shallot, thinly sliced. 1 lemongrass stalk, finely chopped. 4 garlic cloves, grated. 1 birds-eye chilli, finely chopped. 500g pork mince. 1 tbsp fish sauce. 1 tsp dark brown soft sugar. 2 limes, juiced. 2 Little Gem lettuces, leaves separated. Thinly sliced spring onions, shredded carrots, finely chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves, to serve.</p>
        <h2> Method: </h2>
        <p>STEP 1: Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and fry the shallot, lemongrass, garlic and chilli for 3 mins until fragrant. Add the pork mince and stir-fry for about 10 mins more until the pork is cooked through and browned. Add the fish sauce, sugar and lime juice, and cook for a couple more minutes until the pork is coated in the mixture. To freeze, leave to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer bag, seal and lay flat in the freezer (so the mince stays in a thin layer). Will keep for up to two months. Defrost in the fridge overnight before using. Reheat in a dry frying pan over a low heat until piping hot.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 2: Divide the pork mince between the lettuce leaves and garnish with the spring onions, carrots and herbs, then serve.</p>
