        <h1> Shanghai Dumplings </h1></a>
        <p>Prep: 30 Mins. Cook 30m</p>
        <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
        <p>400g plain flour, sifted.
1 tbsp sunflower oil.
2 Chinese cabbage (wombok) leaves.
1 cup (250ml) black vinegar.
2 tbsp ginger, finely shredded.
Sliced red chilli, to serve.
450g pork mince.
125g peeled green prawns, finely chopped.
3 spring onions, finely chopped.
2 tsp caster sugar.
2 tbsp soy sauce.
2 tsp finely grated ginger.</p>
        <h2> Method: </h2>
        <p>STEP 1: Reserve 1/4 cup (35g) flour and place the remaining flour in a bowl. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) boiling water and stir to combine. Gradually add another 1/2 cup (125ml) boiling water, stirring until a dough just begins to form. Add 1/4 cup (60ml) cold water and the oil and stir to combine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 2: Transfer dough to an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook and knead for 5-6 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding the remaining flour if the dough is too sticky. Enclose in plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 3:For the filling, combine all ingredients in a bowl and season well. Set aside.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 4:Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each piece into a log about 3cm in width. Cut the dough into pieces about the size of a golf ball.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 5:On a lightly floured surface, roll the balls out until 2mm thick and cut out 10cm circles. Top a dough round with 1 tablespoon filling, and bring the edges together to form a dumpling, pinching the tops to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and filling, keeping the filled dumplings covered with a damp tea towel while you make the rest.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 6:Arrange cabbage leaves in a steamer. In batches, arrange the dumplings in the steamer and steam for 8-10 minutes until cooked through.</p>
        <br>
        <p>STEP 7:Combine the black vinegar and ginger in a small bowl and serve with the dumplings and sliced chilli.</p>
