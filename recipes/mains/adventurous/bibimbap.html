3 tsp sea salt.
1 1/2 cups spinach, blanched, excess liquid removed.
1 tbsp sesame oil.
1 1/4 tsp sesame seeds.

        <br>
        <p>STEP 4: Meanwhile, heat half the vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook the carrot, stirring, for 2-3 minutes or until just tender. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a bowl. Add the mince to the pan. Cook, stirring to break up any lumps, for 10 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe the pan clean with paper towel.</p>
        <br>
